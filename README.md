# Tennis Research Notes
A community resource for tennis research topics, ideas, and resources

About: I have more tennis research questions and ideas than I have time to pursue. (I suspect I'm not the only one.) People often ask me for suggestions for research topics. Maybe we can address both issues at once.

How this works: I'm going to share some of my notes, in the form of research topics and questions. If there is published work on the question, I may include a link or citation. Depending on how long the list gets, I may make some attempt to organize by category, maybe even splitting into multiple files. We'll see.

How you can help:
- Add a topic/question
- Add a link or citation to one of the existing topics or questions
- Research something on the list. (And if you do so, add a link to your work.)

If you want to add something, please submit a pull request. As long as your submission is on topic (tennis analytics), doesn't duplicate something already on the list, and isn't overtly self-promotional or obnoxious, I'll accept it.

# Tennis Research Topics

Are serve-and-volleys streakier than others?

How often do betting odds favor the lower-ranked player? Is it more frequent on clay? Is it rare enough that using higher ranking as a proxy for market favorite is acceptable?

Are breaks more frequent immediately after winning a set? (Jeff might have done this one.)

Which players have the greatest variation in serve speed? (Among first serves, or between first and second serves.) Does it have any effect on, say, the success of second serves?

Does winning a very long game (e.g. a game with 6+ deuces) influence the outcome of the next game, or represent some more general momentum shift?

Can Elo ratings be improved to take surface into account?
Can Elo ratings be improved to take missed time (due to injury, etc) into account?
How much does Elo inflation affect ATP/WTA ratings? Can this be addressed for better era comparisons?
How to integrate challenger (and other lower-level) results into Elo ratings?

Do big servers (Isner/Karlovic) win more return points in tiebreaks (or when close in sets) than otherwise? Might be a proxy for whether they're tanking return games.

Any way to use MCP data -- rally length, shot direction -- to come up with approximate distance run, by combining MCP data with distance run when distance is available?

Who are the best "frontrunners?" Win% when up a break ... when up a set.

Serve + 1 tactic -- who does it the most often? Success rates when attempting it (i.e. winners vs UFEs on third shot) ... relationship to other stats, more general success rate.

Are there players who get a lot of service winners (or unreturned serves in general) but not a lot aces? Or are aces a reliable proxy for unreturned serves in general?

When serving for set -- does failing to do so swing momentum in the other direction, esp if fail at 6-5 and then play tiebreak?

"life change effect" for late first-time slam winners (like Wawrinka) -- do they play worse than expected for some period after the slam win?

Can we get a more rounded perspective on surface speed using MCP data? (aces + service winners, serve+1, rally length)

[ I have a lot more, but I'm taking a break... ]
